# Update Rundown

### Makefile
1. Rearranged the file structure
2. Updated Commands
    - `make f` runs the front end on port 3000 localhost (see terminal for link)
    - `make img` same as old `make env` command. Builds the image then opens the container in the command line.
    - `make run` now opens the container after its been dettached using `exit`
    - `make stop` will stop the container after its been dettached using `exit`. Use this so you can keep the container and run it again later without having to build again.
### Dockerfile
1. Removed installation of build-essential because we don't need gcc (yet?)
2. Added `apt-get install make` from build-essential for smaller download
3. Added npm, and live-server download
4. Image now exposes container ports `8080` for front, and `3000` for back
5. Once image is built, it opens the container with tmux. Opening with split would't work without additional exe files. This keeps it simple enough.
